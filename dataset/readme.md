# Dataset
We use a portion of the [NIH Chest X-ray dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/alkzar90/NIH-Chest-X-ray-dataset) as our dataset. The dataset contains 25000 images of chest X-rays, with 14 different diseases.

Due to large file size, we are unable to upload the dataset to the repository. However, you can download the dataset from the [google drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GTWlKciNyAwJCjz8Id9kCnnpuKev4Sxb/view?usp=drive_link).
